# Task1-Data-Cleaning-and-Preprocessing

Goal:-

The objective of this Task is to preprocess and clean the raw sales data to render it suitable for analysis. This encompasses dealing with missing values, fixing data inconsistencies, and making the dataset accurate, consistent, and ready for further analytics or modeling work.

What I Did:-

1. Imported the raw data (Sales Dataset.xlsx) into pandas.

2. Explored the data to verify data types, missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

3. Deal with missing values by filling or deleting them as required.

4. Deleted duplicate and unnecessary records.

5. Normalized data formats (e.g., date, categorical values).

6. Corrected errors and cleaned noisy data.

7. Stored the preprocessed and cleaned dataset for future use in analytics or machine learning processes.
